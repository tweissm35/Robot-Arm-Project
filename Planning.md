##Goal
Use a color sensor to sort, stack, and unstack boxes
Have a mode where the arm can be controlled by 4 potentiometers and a button
Have an indicator LED that displays the current color of the box
Use an electromagnet to pick up the boxes
Use a color sensor to detect the color of a box

##Design
Will use 3 standard servos and 1 micro servo
All of them are 180° servos
The boxes will start in holes on the base, in a circle
The boxes will be laser cut acrylic and the magnets will be glued into place
4 potentiometers and 1 button are needed for the manual control mode
The color sensor will be arranged next to the electromagnet, but not necessarily right up against it
The base will rotate with a gear system, so the servo isn’t in the center of rotation
The majority of the arm will be made from laser cut acrylic



##Schedule
12/5: Begin planning
12/6: Begin Solidworks design
12/6: Begin code and wiring
1/17: Finish Solidworks design & begin laser cutting/3D printing
2/25: Finish assembly, begin documentation
2/28: Finish project
